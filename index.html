            <h1>Ibis appreciation in Brisbane</h1>
        </header>
        <p>The Australian White Ibis (Threskiornis molucca) is a native Australian bird and is protected under State Wildlife Legislation (Nature Conservation Act 1992). It is a serious offence to harm an ibis.</p>
        <p>The ibis plays an important role in natural pest management as it preys on small insects and grubs. While increasing population must be managed, their long-term conservation is necessary for maintaining the variety of all plants and animals.</p>
        <p>Their usual habitat is swampy or water-covered ground, but they are also common in grasslands, wetlands, parks, beaches and mudflats. Their diet includes crustaceans, insects, frogs, fish and snails. Because they are an adaptable species, they are also found in urban areas where they may become aggressive and intimidating to humans.</p>
